# cloud_files

This is a commercial project: web service to store client's files in the cloud. It is a simple and relyable realization of basic json API such as:
- retrieve file list
- upload/download file
- rename file
- delete file to trash
- keep and manage backup files
- managing personal client's RSA-keys to store files encrypted

Cloud service realized as a Django project.
Each client has access to personal files only but it's possible to improve API and allow client's to share their files using common keys.
